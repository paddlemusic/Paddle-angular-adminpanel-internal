            Welcome to Paddle Music! 
          </p><br>
          <p>
            The Paddle Music Service is established and distributed to you by Paddle LLC. All intellectual property rights of this Service are maintained by Paddle LLC, and your commitment to the following material is imperative to using and interacting with the Paddle Music Service. The Terms of Use below are a binding agreement between you (the “user”) and Paddle LLC. Through your creation of a Paddle Music account, you are entering this agreement. 
          </p><br>

          <p>
            An outline of these Terms is stated here:
          </p><br>

                   <li>1-The Paddle Music Service is a social media platform aimed to facilitate a fast and simple sharing and discovery of music. </li>

           <br>

        <h4 class="title mb-3 font-semibold text-lg">THE PADDLE MUSIC SERVICE</h4>
        <div class="description text-gray-200">
          <p>
            By creating an account on Paddle Music, you are engaging and interacting with the Paddle Music Service and becoming a member of the Paddle Music community. Paddle Music’s objective is to aid in the personal and interpersonal discovery of new music. It’s no secret that music is one the fundamental aspects to the human experience: inspiration, comfort, relaxation, communication, and love are all benefits that music can provide to its listener. Everything that Paddle LLC does through the Paddle Music Service is to spread these benefits and improve the human experience. 
</p>
            <br>
            <p>A. The Paddle Music Community
                The Paddle Music community is optimistic, open-minded, and secure for all users. The team at Paddle LLC has a main priority of ensuring that the platform is a beacon of acceptance and positivity. Anything that goes against 
                the Paddle Community Guidelines is not welcome, and can be reported to Paddle LLC. 
                All of Paddle Music’s resources (including any data and information provided to the Service)
                 are committed to removing any potentially harmful content, and/or reporting that content to 
                 law enforcement. </p><br>
             <p>B. Personalized Content
                In order to facilitate the most effective and personalized music sharing experience, Paddle LLC may spotlight material that relates to you. This individualized pushing of content uses data and information that you create/provide 
                when engaging with the Paddle Music Service. Paddle LLC is committed not only to conducting 
                meaningful experiences with musical content and other users, but to maintaining the safety of
                 the platform. Your information is crucial to accomplishing both of these</p>
              <br>  
              <p>
                C. Encountering Third Party Influences
                You will encounter Third Party involvement when using the Paddle Music Service. 
                <br>
                    • Paddle Music uses Application Programming Interfaces (“APIs”) to communicate with Third Party streaming services, including Spotify and Apple Music. Because of these services, you can listen to music while you browse with the Paddle Music Service. These special privileges are meant to enrich the user experience.<br>
                    • Your user data and information is utilized to provide you with personalized advertisements from Third Party businesses. Sponsored posts are by no means meant to take away from participation with the Paddle Music Service.

    <h4 class="title mb-3 font-semibold text-lg">YOUR PRIVACY AND DATA</h4>
    <div class="description text-gray-200">
      <p>
        The privacy of your user data and information is something that Paddle LLC holds with the utmost seriousness and professionalism. To monitor the information that you share with Paddle Music (and other Paddle Music users), you may adjust your settings within the application, or, in extreme cases, refrain from using Paddle Music altogether, which includes terminating or refusing to register your account. Visit Paddle Music’s “Privacy Policy” for more information. Agreeing to the “Privacy Policy” is a requirement to use the Paddle Music Service.

    <h4 class="title mb-3 font-semibold text-lg">PERMISSIONS GRANTED TO PADDLE</h4>
    <div class="description text-gray-200">
      <p>
        A. Personal Content Distribution <br><br>

        By agreeing to the Terms, you grant Paddle Music unlimited permission to publicly present, distribute, refer to, and freely recreate your user content. This includes anything that you post from your Paddle Music account (being distributed to whoever Paddle LLC sees fit). Intellectual property rights over your user content remain with you. However, Paddle LLC has complete liberty to utilize this content in whichever way it feels fits the needs for conducting the Paddle Music Service. You give Paddle LLC the legal license to use all of your user content, without compensation. 
        
        Examples of user content include items such as your account information (name, username, bio, profile picture, etc.), accounts that you interact with (followers and following), your favorite songs and artists, and any other activities that you create with Paddle Music.
        
        In terms of the removal and modification of your user content, Paddle LLC cannot make the promise to alter, modify, or delete user content and accounts immediately after that action is taken by the user because of limitations in Paddle Music’s system. Paddle LLC understands that this is not ideal. See “User Content Removal and Modification” for more information on this.
        
        If you do not agree to these provisions, don’t engage with Paddle Music. You can not upload any form of user content to Paddle Music if you do not agree to these provisions. You can always terminate your account with Paddle Music, which is the first step to halt the distribution of your personal user content. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        B. Advertisements<br> <br>
        You grant Paddle LLC the permission to send you advertisements when engaging with the Paddle Music Service. Paddle LLC may utilize your personal information to send you targeted advertisements from specific companies, however Paddle LLC does not sell that information to these advertising partners. Some statistical analyses (including demographics and other impersonal data) may be shared with advertisers, but your contributions to this data can not be traced back to your identity. 
    </p><br>
    <p>Advertisers pay Paddle LLC to promote their products and services.</p>

    <br>
    <p>C. Other Rights Granted to Paddle<br><br>
        Any rights or permissions not expressly granted to you (here or anywhere in the Terms), is a right given 
        to Paddle LLC. This includes all rights that are required for Paddle LLC to execute the 
        Paddle Music Service, as described and as implied, on your mobile device, whether that be practically, visually, or electronically. LLC also reserves all rights or permissions that are implied anywhere in these Terms. 
        All of this is true to the furthest extent of the law.</p>
    </div>

<div class="flex flex-col text-base mb-6">
    <h4 class="title mb-3 font-semibold text-lg">COMMUNITY GUIDELINES</h4>
    <div class="description text-gray-200">
      <p>
        In order to create an account and engage with the Paddle Music Service, you must follow our Community Guidelines. We do not compromise on any of the conditions below, and violation of any of these guidelines may result in the deletion of your user content or account altogether. By agreeing to the Terms, you are committing to abiding by every provision that this section asserts and/or implies.
<br><br>
Just because the Paddle Music Community Guidelines prohibit the actions mentioned in this section, it does not promise that you will not encounter violations of these rules when using the Paddle Music Service. The partial or non-existent enforcement of these guidelines does not suggest that they are somehow void by lack of action on the part of Paddle Music. The Community Guidelines are strict and binding rules to using the Paddle Music Service and a fundamental commitment that you make by creating an account on this platform. 
      </p><br>
    </div>
    <div class="description text-gray-200">
        <p>By agreeing to the Terms, you are also agreeing to the following restrictions: </p>
        <div>

                <li>3-You can’t share or accept the username and password of your account or another user’s account; securing the privacy of your username and password is your responsibility </li>

                <li>7-You can’t participate in any activity that intentionally or unintentionally undermines the intended or actual function of the Paddle Music Service, these activities include anything deemed limiting by Paddle LLC, along with the actions that this section/provision inherently implies </li>
                <li>8-You can’t conspire to obtain data or information about the Paddle Music Service or its users, especially with malicious, financial, or personnel-related intent</li>
                <li>9-You can’t use any data or information, relating to your or others’ account(s), for any type of personal financial gain, including dealing or distributing anything you may encounter while using the Paddle Music Service (usernames, passwords, etc. should never be sold, for giving that information to anyone violates the Community Guidelines and the Terms)</li>
                <li>10-You can’t deal or distribute the account information from another user, including anything that violates another’s intellectual property rights (this applies to the furthest extent of the law)</li>
                <li>11-You can’t use the domain property or moniker of a website or unrelated service as/in your username</li>
                <li>12-You can’t recreate, transcribe, or extract any electronic coding or software engineering of the Paddle Music Service; any actions that are lawfully impermissible regarding the electronic code and function of the Paddle Music Service are prohibited here; the interworking of Paddle Music may not be tampered with, experimented on, or used for anything other than what they are intended for</li>
                <li>13-You can’t recreate, transcribe, or extract the intellectual property, trademarks, and other related designs or software of Paddle Music</li>
                <li>14-You can’t use or create an account with Paddle Music if you have already been kicked off or prohibited from using the Paddle Music Service in the past</li>
                <li>15-You can’t use or create an account with Paddle Music if engaging with the Paddle Music Service violates any personal prohibitions inflicted on oneself under the law</li>
                <li>16-You can’t do anything that violates Paddle Music’s Terms of Use </li>

<div class="flex flex-col text-base mb-6">
    <h4 class="title mb-3 font-semibold text-lg">CONTENT WARNING AND LIABILITY</h4>
    <div class="description text-gray-200">
      <p>
        Although Paddle LLC upholds the Community Guidelines, the inevitability of encountering 
        breeches in these rules is something that Paddle LLC can’t fully prevent. 
        Paddle LLC doesn’t assert that the Paddle Music Service is void of material that is
         potentially harmful to you. By agreeing to the Terms, you acknowledge that you may 
         encounter this potentially harmful material, and hereby promise to not hold Paddle LLC 
         responsible for any harassment you may experience while using the Paddle Music Service.
     </p>
     <br>
     <p>
        Paddle Music is a platform designed to share music safely, efficiently, and enjoyably. However, one instance of potentially harmful material may be the music itself. Accounts that you are subject to, because you are following them or otherwise, may post explicit material. This includes words, phrases, philosophies, or other musical components that may be offensive to you. Paddle LLC suggests that you unfollow or avoid areas of the Paddle Music Service that you could see being problematic to your personal morals, beliefs, or preferences. 
     </p>
     <br>
     <p>
        Another instance where you may encounter some potentially harmful material is when interacting with other users. Captions, biographies, profile pictures, or other user content may be offensive to you. Again, Paddle LLC cannot prevent this. By agreeing to the Terms, you acknowledge that you will possibly be subject to this material, and agree to not hold Paddle LLC responsible for anything regarding the content of other users.
     </p>
     <br>
     <p>
        The only one responsible for user content is the user that posts that content. In the case of a claim brought against Paddle Music on the behalf of the user content of you or others, you promise to indemnify Paddle Music. You promise to not hold Paddle Music morally or financially responsible for anything harmful found on the platform, as stated and implied in the previous paragraphs of this section. You forfeit all rights to deny maltreatment or damaging content and subsequent rights regarding your identity being linked with user content. 
     </p>
     <br>
     <p>
        When you engage with the Paddle Music Service, you will potentially encounter the good and the bad, and that engagement is a willing, self-responsible choice. The surefire way to avoid material while using the Paddle Music Service is to undownload the application immediately and/or delete your Paddle Music account. This is more effective than reporting.
     </p>
     <br>
     <p>Paddle LLC does not stand in accordance with any harmful material present on the Paddle Music platform.</p>

    </div>
</div>
<!-- ---------------------------------------- -->
<div class="flex flex-col text-base mb-6">
    <h4 class="title mb-3 font-semibold text-lg">USER CONTENT MODIFICATION AND REMOVAL </h4>
    <div class="description text-gray-200">
      <p>Paddle LLC has a commitment to construct a platform that is safe and secure for all users. To maintain this commitment, Paddle LLC may have to engage in the monitoring, altering, and/or deletion of user content and accounts. Paddle LLC can remove or modify any content from the Paddle Music Service for whichever reason Paddle LLC sees fit; whether that be because some piece of content transgresses the Community Guidelines (such as copyright infringement) or the Terms in general, because some legal action may warrant the review of information, or because Paddle LLC feels that deletion will maintain the safety of the platform (this is to be interpreted as giving Paddle LLC the unwavering authority in all cases on what is deemed as necessary to “maintaining the safety of the platform”). It is Paddle LLC’s legal right to stop providing you with the Paddle Music Service, or any degree of the Paddle Music Service, at any time. Paddle LLC may monitor, alter, or delete any content from the Paddle Music platform that it feels could potentially result in legal backlash at the expense of Paddle LLC. If you are subject to any of these executive content removal or modification actions, you hereby maintain that Paddle LLC has no responsibility or obligation to you or your user content.</p>
      <br>
      <p>
        After you, or after Paddle LLC deletes your user content, it may take a moment to actually disappear from the platform due to limitations in Paddle Music’s system. When you delete your user content or account, Paddle LLC has no obligation to enact that action in any specified amount of time. There is an instance where your user content or account could be accidentally deleted/modified by Paddle LLC. In this case, you indemnify Paddle LLC for this minor error, and then may contact Paddle LLC immediately to fix whatever error occurred. If you have deleted your user content or account and it fails to disappear from the platform, there could be reasons for this (see below).
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>Your user content or account may not be deleted/modified if…</p>
      <div>
          <ul>
              <li>1-its removal thwarts Paddle LLC from recognizing the breakage of the Paddle Music Community Guideline or the Terms of Use</li>
              <li>2-ts removal works against Paddle LLC’s commitment to keep the platform safe and secure</li>
              <li>3-its removal is prohibited or not required due to some legal/governmental proceedings, actions, or circumstances</li>
              <li>4-its removal is something Paddle LLC feels endangers the platform or is unwarranted in any way deally, removed user content or accounts will be reinstated or deleted once it has fulfilled its purpose above. However, Paddle LLC is not responsible for keeping that promise to you. Limitations in the Paddle Music system may result in a slower removal and/or modification of user content and accounts. </li>
          </ul>
      </div>
      <br>
      <p>In the case of deleting your account, these Terms of Use will eventually expire. However, as long as your user content and account remain on Paddle Music, the Terms still apply. Also, in any case that there is legal proceedings of any kind (see “Promises of Arbitration and Indemnification”) taken after you delete your user content and/or account, the Terms of Use that you agree to here still apply.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<!-- --------------------------------------------- -->
<div class="flex flex-col text-base mb-6">
    <h4 class="title mb-3 font-semibold text-lg">THIRD PARTY INVOLVEMENT </h4>
    <div class="description text-gray-200">
      <p>
        While engaging in the Paddle Music Service, you will likely be communicating with Third Party applications that aid in the download, function, or otherwise of Paddle Music. These relationships will be characterized in this section here.
        </p>
<p>
        (1) Application Programming Interfaces (“APIs”)<br>
In order to stream music directly on the Paddle Music platform, Paddle Music uses Application Programming Interfaces (“APIs”) with specially Spotify and Apple Music. These link your Spotify or Apple Music accounts to your Paddle Music account so that the two can interact simultaneously and create the best user experience for both platforms. To stream music directly within the Paddle Music Service, you must agree to this connection. You must also agree to the Paddle Music equivalent “Terms of Use” of either Spotify or Apple Music. The policies that these Third Party applications assert are agreements between you and them. Paddle Music does not have any part in these agreements, and therefore cannot be held responsible for any problems that you encounter with either of those streaming services. You promise to indemnify Paddle LLC in any case where a problem arises with a Third Party. If you’d like to know more information about your agreements with Spotify or Apple Music, reread them at their respective locations/websites.
</p><br>
<p>
(2) The Apple Store <br>
You have downloaded Paddle Music from the Apple Store, a product and feature of Apple, Inc. And likely, you are using an iOS software. Before creating an account with Paddle Music, you should have read and agreed to the Paddle Music equivalent “Terms of Use.” That agreement is solely between you and Apple. Furthermore, this agreement is solely between you and Paddle LLC. The service Apple provides does not infringe on or assert liability over the Paddle Music Service and vice versa. They are separate entities with separate Terms, and you must agree to both before continuing. 
</p><br>
<p>
(3) Other Third Parties<br>
Despite the information above, the Terms do not grant any rights to anyone other than Paddle LLC and you. Paddle LLC does not enforce, take responsibility for, or particularly support any content or service other than itself. This includes all Third Party involvement, even those unforeseen, unknown, or unaddressed by Paddle LLC. You agree to indemnify Paddle LLC in any and all legal cases with a third party involvement to the furthest extent of the law.
</p>
    </div>
</div>

<!-- -------------------- -->
<div class="flex flex-col text-base mb-6">
    <h4 class="title mb-3 font-semibold text-lg">FOR BETA TESTING</h4>
    <div class="description text-gray-200">
      <p>This version of the Terms of Use is an iteration provided to the Paddle Music “Beta Testing Group.” As you create your Beta Paddle Music account and engage with the Beta Paddle Music Service, you acknowledge to give Paddle LLC the benefit of the doubt regarding any miscalculations or errors that are present in these Terms or in the Paddle Music Service. This means compromising on your own expectations for the Paddle Music Service, upholding indemnification of Paddle LLC to the furthest extent of the law, promising to engage in arbitration only and only if necessary, and interpreting the Terms with the utmost generosity. In the future, if Paddle LLC claims they intended to imply a particular statement even if that sentiment is not visibly stated or tangentially implied, you must adopt Paddle LLC’s own interpretation of the Terms. You acknowledge that the Paddle Music Service may not be what is exactly described in these Terms, and that what is included in the Paddle Music Service may not function at full capacity. </p>
      <br>
      <p>Any problems that you have with Paddle LLC or the Paddle Music Service will first be addressed directly to Paddle LLC Representatives/Officers in order to come to an amicable solution void of any legal action.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<!-- -------------------- -->
<div class="flex flex-col text-base mb-6">
    <h4 class="title mb-3 font-semibold text-lg">PROMISES OF ARBITRATION AND INDEMNIFICATION </h4>
    <div class="description text-gray-200">
     <p>Paddle LLC, Paddle Music, and all Paddle-related persons and partners are beneficiaries of the rights of this agreement to arbitration and indemnification. These rights may be practiced when disputes arise. These rights are non-transferable without intentional given consent. They are to protect Paddle LLC.</p>
     <br>
     <p>A. Indemnification of Paddle Music and Paddle LLC<br>
        You commit to the indemnification of Paddle Music and Paddle LLC in all instances to the furthest extent that the law will allow. These instances are including but not limited to: (1) a direct or indirect violation of the Terms of Use, (2) problems with obscene or harmful or the removal/modification of obscene or harmful user content, (3) complicated events that aren’t specially cited in the Terms, (4) complicated events that are cited in the Terms elsewhere, (5) malcontent or issues relating to the rights and dominion of third parties, and (6) furthermore. 
        
        Paddle LLC refuses to acknowledge all warranties, implied or otherwise, that could potentially bring harm to Paddle LLC. Anything financially damaging or costing, personally intrusive or censoring, or otherwise that arises from the Terms of Use is not Paddle LLC’s responsibility or liability. By agreeing to the Terms, you are acknowledging this and agree to respect it in the event of any legal proceedings. Paddle LLC has the right to call on you specifically to stand by us in the case of a claim brought against Paddle LLC. You do not waive this right, even when dissatisfied with or arguing against Paddle LLC.
        
        This all applies to the furthest extent possible under the law.
    </p><br>
    <p>B. Your Promise of Arbitration<br>
        You hereby promise to settle all disputes with Paddle LLC and these Terms of Use by individual arbitration. This is a binding promise and commitment that is fundamental to these Terms when you agree to them. You do not have the right to any form of class action, unless specified in the Federal Arbitration Act or elsewhere (for arbitration is ultimately conducted and interpreted at the jurisdiction of the judicial system). In these circumstances, your commitment to the indemnification of Paddle LLC still holds under the furthest extent of the law. 
        
        Before engaging in arbitration, you are required to send Paddle LLC at “paddle.business@gmail.com” your personal and account information, your reason for enacting a dispute with Paddle LLC, and how you would like to be compensated. Ideally, disputes between you and Paddle Music could be handled personally without any form of legal action or arbitration. If Paddle LLC does not respond to your original email, Paddle LLC calls for a resend of the email or a personal notification to one of its owners/officers. If Paddle Music does not originally see your email, Paddle LLC is not at fault for this and thus entitled to more time to look over the notice. You hereby agree to this under the furthest extent of the law. Upon conducting arbitration or other legal proceedings, you acknowledge and agree that Paddle LLC is only responsible for paying the lowest amount of court fees or monetary counterparts that the law deems necessary. This still applies if that amount is zero dollars. Paddle LLC maintains the right to choose when and which court the legal arbitration or action takes place. In the event that Paddle LLC loses a case of arbitration (or another legal proceeding), Paddle LLC is only responsible for paying you the amount that you have paid to Paddle LLC in the past year. That amount will be capped at $100. This is all to the furthest extent of the judicial proceedings, the Federal Arbitration Act, and the active laws themselves.
    </p><br>
    <br>
    <p>
        C. Other Clarifications <br>
In the case that any provision of the Terms is unable to be enforced, the remainder of the Terms still apply to Paddle LLC and to you. The failure on Paddle LLC’s part to enforce the Terms does not mean that the respective provisions are implicitly void or no longer a binding part of the Terms. Paddle LLC is rewarded all rights that are not given directly to you by the Terms. Everything in this section and in the Terms of Use are subject to the furthest extent of the law and have no self-inflicted limitations, or limitations implied by lack of clarification.

    <p>ALL PROMISES OF ARBITRATION AND INDEMNIFICATION ARE STILL ACTIVE UPON THE TERMINATION OR UNUPDATED EXPIRATION OF THESE TERMS.</p>

        In the future, Paddle LLC plans to revise the Terms of Use. The Paddle Music Service will inevitably evolve, and with it these Terms will evolve as well. When the Terms of Use are updated, Paddle LLC will make sure to present the new agreement to you (if legally necessary). With the agreement to those new Terms of Use, you will be able to continue your account with Paddle Music and further explore the future of music.
